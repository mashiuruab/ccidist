JDBC Drivers
=============

CCI Distribution service supports multiple databases. Currently, MySQL & Oracle
is supported. However, to work with these database system, a JDBC driver is
required. Please download the appropriate driver and put it in this folder. The
Distribution service will automatically pick up the drivers from here.

MySQL Driver: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
Oracle Driver: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html

Thanks and regards!
